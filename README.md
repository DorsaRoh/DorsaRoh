I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Deep Genomics. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Toronto.  This project won four hackathons and contributed to my 11 total hackathon wins, earning me recognition as one of the youngest MLH Top 50 Hackers out of 150,000+ hackers worldwide.

Iâ€™m fascinated by the intersection of AI and neuroscience, currently investigating whether the underlying architectures behind large language models (LLMs) can support or exhibit consciousness. My interests lie in deep learning, genomics, and understanding the principles that might bridge AI and biological intelligence.
